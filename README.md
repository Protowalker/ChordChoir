# ChordChoir  
You shouldn't have to play an instrument to play with chords  

----
## What is it?  
It's a tool for intuitively building complex chord progressions  

## Who's it for?  
There are two primary audiences:  
- People who don't understand how chord progressions work and would like to
- People who do understand chord progressions and want to play with them, but either aren't proficient enough at an instrument or don't want to bother with one  

## Why is it so ugly?  
Because I've never made a front-end before. ;-;

## I would like to make it less ugly.  
Please god do it. PRs are welcome (for both logic and visuals!)
